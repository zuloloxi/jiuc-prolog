POEM comes in four files.

    POEM.PRE        - This file.
    POEM.TXT        - Documentation.
    POEM.PL         - The Prolog source of the translator.
    POEMSHAPES.PL   - A demonstration program.


To run  Poem, consult  POEMSHAPES.PL. It consults  POEM.PL right  at the
start: POEM then translates the  rest of POEMSHAPES; the translated code
puts out some demonstration answers.


CHECKED ON EDINBURGH-COMPATIBLE (POPLOG) PROLOG : yes.


PORTABILITY :

    See notes at the top of POEM.PL and POEMSHAPES.PL                   

DOCUMENTATION :

    (1) A separate description of  POEM's class description syntax, main
    predicates, and how class descriptions are translated into Prolog.

    (2) Comments in the program for important predicates and methods.
