1. About
--------

JIProlog is a Prolog interpreter, pure Java 100%, cross-platform and Open Source.
JIProlog offers a high degree of compliance with official and de facto Prolog standards.
It also supports built-in predicates and other features common to major Prolog systems.
JIProlog enhances the Java platform by adding the power of Prolog language and extends
Prolog by adding the Java framework.
It integrates Prolog and Java languages in a very fashinating way. It allows 
calling Prolog predicates from Java without dealing with native code (JNI) and
allows invoking Java methods from Prolog as they were predicates.
It supplies a complete API to link Prolog and Java languages from both sides. 
The API can is composed of three parts: 
- Java calls Prolog; 
- Prolog calls Java; 
- Prolog links JDBC databases.

By design, JIProlog is compliant with Web 3.0 and the mobile world.

The home of JIProlog is: http://www.jiprolog.com

JIProlog is open source and it is release under AGPLv 3.0 or under commercial license.

-----------------

Contributions, constructive criticism, patches, bug reports, and suggestions

as the compiler, runtime, adapter files, library files, or tools can only be
accepted with a transfer of copyright or if the submitted code is explicitly
declared as public domain code. This simplifies the selling of commercial
licenses, which provide a revenue source for the sustained development of
JIProlog.
